<h4 align="center">About me</h4>
<p align="center">I'm a freshman computer science student who is really excited about all the possibilities that this field has to offer. 
   I'm really interested in learning new programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies, 
   and I can't wait to start putting all that knowledge to use. In my free time, I love tinkering with new technologies 
   and keeping up with all the latest developments in the field. I'm also a strong collaborator and I really enjoy working with others to solve challenging problems.
